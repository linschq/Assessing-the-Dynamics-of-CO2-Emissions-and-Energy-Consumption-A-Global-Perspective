# Assessing the Dynamics of CO2 Emissions and Energy Consumption: A Global Perspective

The data I got are from https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions 

Summary of the Data Cleaning and Analysis Process from the Research "Assessing the Dynamics of CO2 Emissions and Energy Consumption: A Global Perspective":

1. Initial Statistical Description:
The initial description is carried out to understand the general characteristics of the dataset, involving the use of functions such as describe() and visualization with histograms.
This step provides initial insight into the distribution, range of values, and basic statistics of the variables involved in the study.
2. Identification and Handling of Missing Values:
Identification and handling of missing values is performed to ensure the data used in the analysis is clean and complete.
Functions like dropna() or filling values using specific methods are used depending on the context of the variable.
3. Column and Row Selection:
Column and row selection is carried out to focus analysis on relevant variables and quality data.
The selection was made based on the objectives of the analysis and the relevance of the variables to the research questions.
4.Advanced Descriptive Analysis:
Advanced descriptive analysis can involve clustering, calculation of means, medians, and additional visualizations to understand more deeply the characteristics of the dataset.
This analysis may involve selecting clean and relevant data.
5. Hypothesis testing:
Hypothesis testing is carried out to validate or reject certain research hypotheses.
Data cleaning may be more stringent at this stage to meet the statistical assumptions of the test used (e.g., Pearson correlation test).
Use of statistical functions and methods such as pearsonr() from the scipy.stats module to calculate correlation and p-value.
6. Result Visualization:
The results of hypothesis testing or statistical analysis can be visualized to provide better understanding.
Using scatter plots or other plots can help demonstrate relationships between variables.
7. Data Preprocessing Goals:
Data preprocessing was carried out to ensure the reliability and validity of the analysis results.
Involves steps such as addressing missing values, identifying and dealing with outliers, and ensuring that the data meets required assumptions.
